# Patient-Queue
This is an assignment from Stanford CS106X course
This is to simulate a group of patients queuing in a hospital. This is an implementation of priority queue, which allows patients with more urgent needs to be processed earlier. There are two ways to implement this: 1. to linearly search for the place at which the new patient should be positioned. 2. to find the correct place to position the new patient by skipping acccording to the "levels" of the patients already in the queue.
